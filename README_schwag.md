One of our sponsorship items is Lanyard Sponsor. If we have a Lanyard Sponsor, we print up the lanyards with their name and logo. It's a fairly sought-after item as many attendees keep their badges. [We've ordered from Custom Lanyards here](https://www.customlanyard.net/lanyards/custom-dye-sublimation-lanyards) with the following configuration:

1. Polyester
2. 5/8", Standard Length, Standard Quality, Laser Print
3. Quanities:
    * 400 Light Green (to indicate photographs are okay)
    * 50 Red (to indicate photos are NOT okay)
    * 50 Yellow (to indicate to ask before taking a photo)
4. Enter the Lanyard Sponsor's name and upload the logo. Make sure the logo is just black and transparent.
5. Single clip CL-1
6. Sewing is fine
7. No lanyard upgrades
8. No reels or keychains
9. No badge holders
10. 25 free lanyards
