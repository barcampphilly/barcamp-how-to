We communicated with them by email. The Adobe Illustrator files for the 2023 shirt (front and back) and a high-res version of the BarCamp logo [are available in the Google Drive "Graphical Assets" folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1le3xQE7pceMQBCmwvVBXbDCI77Qk61Od).

In 2023, we ordered higher quality BELLA+CANVAS (3001C) Ladies and Straight-Cut shirts based on the percentage of attendees registered at the deadline. We asked for peoples' sizes during ticket purchase on TicketLeap. We ordered 402 attendee shirts, and 12 organizer shirts. (Too many! Get 350!) The cost for the 414 shirts in total was $4,628.76.

## Lanyards

Previous Vendor: [Custom Lanyards](https://www.customlanyard.net/)

One of our sponsorship items is Lanyard Sponsor. If we have a Lanyard Sponsor, we print up the lanyards with their name and logo. It's a fairly sought-after item as many attendees keep their badges. [We've ordered from Custom Lanyards here](https://www.customlanyard.net/lanyards/custom-dye-sublimation-lanyards) with the following configuration:

1. Polyester
2. 5/8", Standard Length, Standard Quality, Laser Print
3. Quanities:
    * 400 Light Green (to indicate photographs are okay)
    * 50 Red (to indicate photos are NOT okay)
    * 50 Yellow (to indicate to ask before taking a photo)
4. Enter the Lanyard Sponsor's name and upload the logo. Make sure the logo is just black and transparent.
5. Single clip CL-1
6. Sewing is fine
7. No lanyard upgrades
8. No reels or keychains
9. No badge holders
10. 25 free lanyards
