# How to Run a BarCamp Philadelphia

BarCamp Philadelphia is an unconference by the Philly community, for the Philly community. The organization team morphs from year to year since its inception in 2008. It typically happens every Fall, although a few years were missed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This documentation serves as a "how-to" of what we've learned over the years. It is meant to be a living, breathing document as the event evolves.

If you're organizing this year: make it yours! BarCamp has always been an event where all ideas are valid, and consensus rules. It has always been organizer by unpaid volunteers.

## 1. Getting Space

BarCamp can't happen without space for the event. We have been lucky enough to hosting BarCamp at The Wharton School since 2012. Several Wharton staff can be contacted to help reserve the space for a date, including Tim Allen, Ryan Sullivan, Antonio Vivas, and JM Conway. Securing the space and a date must be completed before much else can be done.

## 6. Schwag

BarCamp Philly has needed several items printed in the past. These normally have a fairly long lead time - and we can get better prices the sooner we order:

* [T-Shirts](README_schwag.md#t-shirts)
* [Lanyards](README_schwag.md#lanyards)
* [Badges](README_schwag.md#badges)
* [Sponsor Banners](README_schwag.md#sponsor-banners)

## 7. Needs day Of

On the day of there are a number of things that are SUPER helpful to have in your handy dandy 'toolbox'. This is not an exhaustive list but a good starting point:

* Scisors (At least 3 pairs) - SHARP ones.
* Sharpies (20-30 of a variety of colors) - These are useful in general, for badges and writing cards for the board
* small voting stickers - Small shiny stickers to allow people to vote on the story cards to help prioritize larger rooms to more popular talks
* [Gaff Tape](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gaff+tape) - 3 - 5 Rolls for day of. This is important, GAFF TAPE not packing tape, not duct tape... GAFF tape. As it is meant to be sticky but also to be removable without leaving marks
* Blue Painters tape - As useful day of as the gaff tape is and less expensive.
* Push Pins (100 ish)
* Way finding Signs: As much as we like to think the forum @ wharton is straight forward, it just isn't. Highly consider signs with room numbers/names and arrows, restrooms etc.
