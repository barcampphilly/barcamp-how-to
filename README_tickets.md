# Tickets

We have used TicketLeap for years, and they serve as an in-kind sponsor by waiving their fees. Here are the steps to make that happen.

## 1. Create the Event

* [Log in to TicketLeap](https://www.ticketleap.com/login/) as `info@barcampphilly.org`
* Click on the `EVENTS` tab and `CREATE A NEW EVENT`
* You can copy all the details from the previous year.
    * Update the dates of the event
    * Update the graphics and accent color of the event
* We have typically done two types of tickets:
    * Early Biird tickets, available for several week from the announcement of ticket sales
    * Regular tickets, available until 3PM the day before the event.
* For the `Registration Questions` section, we ask for t-shirt size. It is essential that a t-shirt vendor be selected *BEFORE* you collect this information, so we know the available sizes (ask Tim how he knows sometime).
    * If you choose to use Awesome Dudes Printing for t-shirts again, the sizes for the t-shirt style we used are Straight Cut (S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL, 4XL) and Ladies (S, M, L, XL, 2XL).

## 2. Contact TicketLeap to Make the Event Free

After you have successfully created the event, send the link to TicketLeap. We have emailed `help@ticketleap.com` in the past with a message like this:

SUBJECT: `TicketLeap In-Kind Sponsorship of BarCamp Philadelphia`

BODY:
> Greetings!
> 
> BarCamp Philly is holding our yearly unconference again, and TicketLeap has been our long time in-kind ticket sponsor. Our relationship goes back to a friendship with your founder, Chris Stanchak. In the past we have partnered with TicketLeap where service fees for the event were generally waived in exchange for ad placement on our website, in our promotional emails, and shout-outs at the event. This is the URL we have set up for this year's event; could you set it to be free of fees, and we'll promote you for another year?

That should do it - they'll normally reply within a few days, so give them some lead time.
